cmi5launch
============

A plug in for Moodle that allows the launch of cmi5 content which is then played in a cmi5 player and tracked to a separate LRS. 



##What you will need

To use this plugin you will need the following:

* Moodle 4 fully set up and running on a server that you have ftp access to 
* Login details for the admin account 
* A Moodle course setup where you would like to add the activity
* A piece of cmi5 compliant e-learning that also implements the launch mechanism outlined HERE, for 
example e-learning produced using Articulate Storyline or Adobe Captivate. This should be put on the internet 
somewhere, perhaps on your Moodle server. * A cmi5 compliant LRS (this plugin has been tested with Wax and 
SCORM Cloud) 
* A running instance of the cmi5 player (https://github.com/adlnet/CATAPULT/tree/main/player)
* A copy of this plugin.
